==============================
1. Disclaimer
==============================
Data processing was the hardest part of this project.  There were several 
scripts that we used to process the data from its original format (the 
original VOICE data is included in this zip file) to the final format used
by the SVM machine.  However, these scripts are somewhat messy and require
a lot of additional files and steps.  Because of this, we have only included
the final, LOOCV scripts, the Java files used to create the bigrams, and
a sample SVM file.


==============================
2. Run SVM^{multiclass} on a single training file
==============================
To perform a single test and train run of the included SVM file, just go
into the scripts directory and type:
	./run_classifier_users.sh
This will train on the data located in langs_users/all.bottomBigram.dictionFeats.noUND.top15-K500-N30.train
and test for each language in to_use_lang.txt.  It will also use another script
to create a confusion matrix for each language, and will open the confusion 
matrix in VIM after everything is done.


==============================
3. Run LOOCV on the training file
==============================
To run the LOOCV, go into the scripts directory and type:
	./run_cv.pl ../langs_users/all.bottomBigram.dictionFeats.noUND.top15-K500-N30.train output.cv.txt 1
This will run LOOCV with the training file specified, printing to the output
file output.cv.txt and using the value of C=1 for SVM^{multiclass}.  Run the
script:
	./create_confusion.pl output.cv.txt > confusion.cv.txt
to create the confusion matrix for this run.
